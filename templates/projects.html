            <em class="subHeading">Off The Grid : Blackbaud. Summer 2016 - finalist</em><br />
            Door To More was created in 24 hours to benefit advocacy organizations that would employ individuals to canvass
            door to door or on the street to raise awareness, solicit donations, and add to in-house files. The purpose of the
            app is to create a streamlined interface where canvassers can quickly create new constituents and document the interaction
            in a way that advocacy organizations can aggregate or target these constituents in the future.<br />

        As I was learning html, css, javascript, angularjs, and other web technologies during my internship at Blackbaud I decided to
        create this website to solidify what I was using. This website is intended to give a quick overview of my resume in a web format
        and provide links to other personal websites while having a friendly UI that can be accessed on phone or pc.Through this website's
        development I am becoming more adept with web technologies and am proud of the modular parts that I continue to add.<br /><br />
        
        Base Converter : This small webapp is an extension of my website that I decided to make to gain experience with AngularJS. 
        Often in my classes I would convert between different numeric bases and would often use online converters to double check my work.
        This tool was made as a conveince for me so that I am able to quickly navigate to a base converter to quickly check over conversions.<br />

        <b>Research File Anonymizer</b><br />
        <em class="subHeading">Created by Thomas Ortiz. Spring 2016</em><br />
        This java program was developed to quickly anonymize student files by removing identifying information such as email,
        names, and @author tags and replacing them with encrypted ids generated by the research director.
        As the program parses through student files it creates new anonymized files and saves the new files into a directory
        called Anon_Submissions while preserving the old copies of the files.
