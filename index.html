              I am currently a senior in computer science at NC State University and I will be graduating in Fall 2017.
              My prior experience includes being a teaching assistant for CSC 116 (Introduction to Java) working under
              Dr. Schmidt and Ms. ToniAnn Marini.
              I currently work as a Computer Science Research Assistant under Dr. Schmidt and Dr. Heckman where we
              research on how to improve
              teaching CSC 116 and how to gamify both CSC 116 and CSC 216. This past summer I was a Software Engineer
              Intern at Blackbaud.

              <span class="indent">
                During my second internship at Blackbaud I worked as a full-stack developer on their web platform
                Financial Edge Nxt (FEnxt).
                I worked with a scrum team performing bi-weekly sprints to continuously integrate new features into
                FEnxt. <br /><br />

                Specifically, my intern project was working in C# .net for backend work and then developing with Angular
                1.x for the frontend.
                The project's goal was to add functionality for the user to see the status of a process users can
                trigger.
                Before this project users would kick off the process and it would finish without specific feedback past
                whether
                or not the process worked or didin't from a tiny toast message. Once integrated, my tasks allowed users
                to see how and why processes succeeded or failed and provided a history log of each process.<br /><br />

                After finishing my project I moved on to other sprint tasks with my team.
                Some examples of tasks I completed include optimizing end point tests,
                bug fixing across the product, and additional feature implementations. <br /><br />

                During this internship I got more freedom to develop across the entire stack.
                I used C#, SQL, Javascript, jQuery, Angular 1.x, and other web technologies but
                what I was most interested in learning was the entire stack because I got a better understanding on how
                web applications work.

              <span class="indent">
                During my internship at Blackbaud, I developed on Blackbaud's leading product - <b>Financial Edge 7</b>.
                I added data analytics by implementing Mixpanel into FE7 with Visual Basic 6 in order to understand
                how customers utilize FE7. After implementing data analytics into FE7 my implementation was adopted by
                two other leading products at Blackbaud - <b>Raiser's Edge</b> and <b>Education Edge</b>.<br /><br />

                After finishing my main summer project I worked on a team of 8 in an agile environment where we
                developed on
                Financial Edge NXT where I focused on non-profit intelligence and financial data analysis.<br /><br />

                During this internship I learned and solidified VB6, C#, SQL, Javascript, Jquery, AngularJS, and other
                web technologies.

            <b class="textHeader">Jenkins Dashboard</b><br />
            <em class="subHeading">NCSU - CSC Research - Spring/Summer 2017</em>
            <span class="indent">
              Problem:<br />
              Computer Science courses use Jenkins to automate the build process and grading in many CSC classes.
              Student
              can see this output but the useful output is cluttered across Jenkin's website making it either hard to
              read or difficult
              to find out where to look.<br /><br />

              Solution:<br />
              Our solution is to extend and utilize the data collection our team was already doing through build scripts
              and display all the neccessary project output information
              in a consolidated format. <br /><br />

              Outcome:<br />
              Using Django, we built a dashboard for Teaching Assistant and students to easily look at build output.
              While originally this project was for one class, Java II,
              my team and other teachers saw the value in this project and as such we built the project to be easily
              modifiable depending on what class needs it. The current plans
              for this project is to use it in all classes in NCSU's CSC program that uses Jenkins to automate
              builds.<br /><br />

              Learning Outcomes:<br />
              Back-End Development, Front-End Development, Django, Jenkins, SQL

            <span class="indent">
              Overview:<br />
              Over the course of a semester in Software Engineerings (CSC 326) our team performed improvements on iTrust
              - a program
              that has been worked on by previous CSC students at NCSU over the past decade. Our team competed with
              other teams in the
              class where we all completed the same requirements in order to create the best iTrust project for that
              semester. At the
              end of the semester our project was selected as best in the class after we presented our project in front
              of both our lab and our entire class.
              <br /><br />
              Goal:<br />
              Use JSF (JavaServer Faces) to implement five additional use cases, refactor logging, secure SQL
              connections
              with prepared statements, implement mocking through Mockito for proper unit testing, and create a docker
              image.
              <br /><br />
              Process: <br />
              The process involved 5 iterations where our team worked in an agile environment. We would meet twice a
              week
              and have stand up meetings to describe where we were on the project and what help, if any, was needed. We
              managed the project through GitHub where we decided to utilize merge requests to code review our merges
              and GitHub issues that we could close as we finished our assignments.

            <span class="indent">
              Door To More was created in 24 hours to benefit advocacy organizations that would employ individuals to
              canvass
              door to door or on the street to raise awareness, solicit donations, and add to in-house files. The
              purpose of the
              app is to create a streamlined interface where canvassers can quickly create new constituents and document
              the interaction
              in a way that advocacy organizations can aggregate or target these constituents in the future.

              and provide links to other personal websites while having a friendly UI that can be accessed on phone or
              pc.Through this websites
              development I hope to become more adept with web technologies.
              <br /><br />
              Overall, this project has taught me how to AngularJS works as I threw myself into using it. I better
              understand modules, controllers,
              routing, and services with angular and I am proud at the modular components I have been able to make.

              Often in my classes I would convert between different numeric bases and would often use online converters

              This tool was made as a convenience for me so that I am able to quickly navigate to a base converter to
              quickly check over conversions.
