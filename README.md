# Tdortiz.github.io

This is a representation of my resume in a web format. Originally, this portfolio website was written with 
Angular in order to solidfy what I was learning over the summer at my internship at Blackbaud. Now, however, 
I went a more basic approach and decided to focus on the user's experience. The old website can still be found 
on this github at https://github.com/Tdortiz/Old-Angular-Website.
